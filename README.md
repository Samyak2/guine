# guine

A quine (self-replicating program) in Go. Inspired by [this article](http://www.madore.org/~david/computers/quine.html) and the first quine example there.

## TODOs

 - [x] Do not assume ASCII
 - [ ] Limit lines to 80 characters or so
 - [x] Make it shorter (<50 lines at least). Update: ~35 lines now!
 - [x] Make it more readable
    - [ ] Document it too
 - [x] Be `go fmt` compatible
